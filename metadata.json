    "Title": "USR descriptors with pharmacophoric constraints",
    "Description": "USRCAT is a real-time ultrafast molecular shape recognition with pharmacophoric constraints. It integrates atom type to the traditional Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) descriptor to improve the performance of shape-based virtual screening, being able to discriminate between compounds with similar shape but distinct pharmacophoric features.",
